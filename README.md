# Hands-On fMRI Workshop (2022)
### Lecturer: Minsun Park
#### Workshop given at VCN lab, Korea University (08.26.2022)  
#### Kewords: _fMRI, MVPA, AFNI, Princeton MVPA toolbox, Machine learning_
  
  
  
In this workshop,  
(1) Learn each step of fMRI data preprocessing using AFNI  
(2) Understand the concept of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA)  
(3) Lean how to handle AFNI to analyze fMRI data and MATLAB toolboxes to conduct MVPA.  

* You can download data files and codes that are required to the workshop.  
* Workshop material is also provided [*here*](https://rhinestone-quail-d35.notion.site/Hands-on-fMRI-Analysis-76f5249ef5074d4daa3eb76ccbb6eff4).  
  * The material includes how to install AFNI and Princeton MVPA toolbox, process fMRI data using AFNI,
and conduct MVPA using the toolbox.
